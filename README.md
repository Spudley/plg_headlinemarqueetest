Headline Marquee Plugin Example
-------------------------------

This is an example plugin for Joomla! to demonstrate how to write news source plugins for the [HeadlineMarquee module](https://github.com/Spudley/mod_headlinemarquee).

HeadlineMarquee is a Joomla! module that provides a scrolling news feed. It can provide headlines from various built-in news sources, including a Joomla! category or an RSS feed, but can also use a separate plugin to provide a news feed. This is an example of such a plugin, provided to demonstrate how to do it and to act as a base starting point for writing your own.


Installation
------------

This is a standard Joomla plugin. Installation is via Joomla's extension manager.

Obviously, you must also have the HeadlineMarquee module installed before it will do anything useful.

As with other Joomla plugins, once installed, you will need to activate it.


Usage
-----

NB: The primary purpose of this plugin is as a demonstration. **It does not do anything useful.**

The plugin does not have any configuration parameters of its own. Instead, once installed and activated, the plugin will modifies the configuration options available to the HeadlineMarquee module.

HeadlineMarquee has a drop-down list of data sources that can be selected. You will notice that this list now includes an option for this plugin. Once you select this option, you will be given two further config paramters into which you can enter anything you like as free text.

If you save these paramters and load your front-end site with the module in place, you will see that they are added as items to the news feed, along with a third item with a fixed value and a URL.

You can read more about how to write a plugin like this by reading the [plugins.md file in the main mod_headlinemarquee repository](https://github.com/Spudley/mod_headlinemarquee/blob/master/plugins.md).

This plugin is written to work with the current version (2.x) of Headline Marquee. It may stop working with future versions if the module's API changes. Please ensure you are using the correct version of the plugin for the version of the module that you have installed.
